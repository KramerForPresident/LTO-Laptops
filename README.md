# LTO-Laptops
A project I've started for work. Need to implement a means for inventorying laptops used by teachers on LTO. Using node.js as a backend with Express server.

This is an ongoing project that I will be adding to over the next month (or so). I would like to get a working version with a MySQL db by the end of April (I don't have a lot of time).

For anyone interested in using, just make sure you have Node.js and NPM installed. Then install your dependencies and you're good to go.
